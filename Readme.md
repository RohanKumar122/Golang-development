# Golang
- Golang does not contains class, It only hace packages.

## Datatypes
- There is no need of defining datatypes, The compiler is smart enough to determin the datatype automatically.
And also at automatically remove semicolons.
- When we save the file it comppiles and check the syntex.

### Shortcut to assign a variable:
 before :
 var person ="Rio"

 after:
 person := "Rio"

 ## Note:
 If we assign any variable starting with capital letter (Person), It can directly export to another file but cannot eccess outside if assign with small starting letter(Person).
 Same is APPLICABLE FOR FUNCTIONS ALSO.
